# Ticket-Lion-UX-Project
Ticket Lion is my user design project that I had worked on in Penn State's IST 331 course: Human-Centered Design.  The goal of the project was to create an interface for an application that would solve an issue.  The issue I decided to tackle was that currently, students did not have an efficient outlet to sell their tickets.  With my application, I opened up the application to all Penn State students and faculty members to be able to buy and sell tickets for local shows, games, etc.
